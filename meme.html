       <div class="SRcaption" id="SRcap01">This meme mashup was made on PhotoShop and is a combination of multiple memes to tell one story. In the mashup there a multiple silly cats fighting each other in Fortnite, and because Fortnite is still massive, I thought it would be the best place to do put these cats in. Each cat has a purpose whether that is to actively fight and react or just be dead/bystander. I also included the two Soyjaks pointing at the scene because I think it pushes the viewer to have that same reaction. 2025 </div>
